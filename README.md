# Dive Log App

## MSD Capstone Project (CS 6019 - Fall 2022)

&nbsp;

### Project

This project is the result of one semester of independent coursework for the University of Utah Master of Software Development Program. The tech stack of Flutter and Firebase was entirely new to me and Firebase was my first experience with a NoSQL database.

I plan to further develop this project beyond the end of the course and the master's program.
